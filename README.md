- **Amortization Schedule**: Generates a detailed month-by-month breakdown of the loan repayment, including principal, interest, and remaining balance.
- **Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio**: Calculates and displays the LTV ratio for each month, showing how the loan balance decreases relative to the original loan amount.
- **Date-Based Schedule**: The schedule starts from a user-specified month and year, with dates formatted as `Month YYYY`.
